<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
We present a sequential convexification procedure to derive, in the limit, a set arbitrary close to the convex hull of $\epsilon$-feasible solutions to a general nonconvex continuous bilinear set. Recognizing that bilinear terms can be represented with a finite number nonlinear nonconvex constraints in the lifted matrix space, our procedure performs a sequential convexification with respect to all nonlinear nonconvex constraints. Moreover, our approach relies on generating lift-and-project cuts using simple 0-1 disjunctions, where cuts are generated at all fractional extreme point solutions of the current relaxation. An implication of our convexification procedure is that the constraints describing the convex hull can be used in a cutting plane algorithm to solve a linear optimization problem over the bilinear set to $\epsilon$-optimality.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
We develop a finitely convergent disjunctive cutting plane algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal solution or detect infeasibility of a general nonconvex continuous bilinear program. While our cutting planes are obtained in a similar manner to Saxena et al. (2010) and Fampa and Lee (2018), a feature of our algorithm that guarantees the finite convergence is exploring near-optimal extreme point solutions to a current relaxation at each iteration. In this sense, our proposed algorithm extends the idea analyzed in Owen and Mehrotra (2001) for solving mixed-integer linear programs to the general bilinear programs.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
The concepts of risk-aversion, chance-constrained optimization, and robust optimization have developed significantly over the last decade. Statistical learning community has also witnessed a rapid theoretical and applied growth by relying on these concepts. A modeling framework, called <i>distributionally robust optimization</i> (DRO), has recently received significant attention in both the operations research and statistical learning communities. This paper surveys main concepts and contributions to DRO, and its relationships with robust optimization, risk-aversion, chance-constrained optimization, and function regularization.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
In this paper, a green transportation location problem is considered with uncertain demand parameter. Increasing robustness influences the number of trucks for sending goods and products, caused consequently, increase the air pollution. In this paper, two green approaches are introduced which demand is the main uncertain parameter in both. These approaches are addressed to provide a trade-off between using available trucks and buying new hybrid trucks for evaluating total costs beside air pollution. Due to growing complexity, a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is applied to find a tight lower bound for each approach. In this propounded algorithm, the main model is decomposed into master and subproblems to speed up convergence with a tight gap. Finally, the suggested algorithm is compared with commercial solver regarding total cost and computational time. Due to computational results for the proposed approach, the Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is provided a close lower bound in less time against commercial solver.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Improving transportation systems are explored from several perspectives, one of which is the reduction of shipping costs, with emphasis on efficient network design. In this research, a three-level transportation location problem included origin, destination and middle warehouses is proposed to design an efficient network for responding to customer’s demand in light of minimizing system costs. In this model, customer demand is assumed uncertain to be able to bring the conditions governing this model closer to real-world situations. In this research, according to demand uncertainty, two stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches have been used to deal with this uncertainty. Also, in order to consider the stochastic programming approach, it is assumed that historical data about demand in reliable and scattered based is available. In the robust optimization, it is assumed that there is no historical data from the past to consider.
Due to the time-consuming and reduced efficiency of commercial optimization softwares in large-scale problems, some algorithms are presented. In this study, Lagrangian and Benders decomposition algorithms are used for implementation on location transportation problem under demand uncertainty.
Finally, for validating the presented study, several numerical examples are presented for each of the proposed models and algorithms to evaluate and verify their performance, and the results of various sensitivity analyses are reported. The computational results show the efficiency and applicability of the model, and the solution methods presented in real conditions compared to the classical solvers and algorithms.</p></article>
