<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
Capacity allocation and cooperative users are growing research areas in supply chain (SC) management; however, the consideration of these novel approaches with disruption propagation effects - namely ripple and bullwhip effects - is scarce. In this study, an SC network containing facilities, normal users, and cooperative users is considered in which the cooperative users possess inventories and can help facilities supply normal users as well. We aim to control the ripple effect by considering the robust optimisation approach and dynamically adjusting the disrupted capacity of facilities. We also manage the bullwhip effect by adjusting the inventories of the cooperative users with a multi-stage stochastic programming formulation. The capacity is allocated to each facility in the worst-case scenario to control future capacity disruptions. Therefore, the worst-case capacity allocation and inventory management can confront the facility capacity disruption in both reactive and proactive ways. Regarding the solution approach, a multi-stage stochastic programming and a robust optimisation approach are developed to control random and deep uncertainties. A suitable scenario tree is constructed by generating scenarios using a Latin Hypercube Sampling method and reducing the scenario tree by applying a forward scenario construction technique. To overcome challenges in solving largescale problems, a hybrid dual decomposition algorithm is suggested based on updating Lagrangian multiplier sets with the combination of cutting plane, sub-gradient, and trust region strategies. The proposed solution algorithm is equipped by Rolling Horizon Heuristic to find a proper upper bound. The outcomes of this research can help decision-makers analyse the value of cooperative users in mitigating ripple and bullwhip

<li><p><b>A Lagrangian-Based Heuristic for a Two-Stage Stochastic Multi-District Asset Protection Problem with Assignment of Disaster Response Groups</b>, with S. Kazazi Darani, M. Bashiri, A. Koliousis </p>
<ul>
<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
One of the most tactical decisions in disaster management is assigning Disaster Response Groups (DRG) to predetermined districts. In the response phase, this assignment protects community assets and infrastructures that are under the risk of destruction when a disaster has occurred. Asset protection is continued to protect individuals, equipment and the environment during a disaster until the risk is reduced to an acceptable level. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer model is proposed for the Multi-District Asset Protection Problem (MDAP) with an uncertain time limit. Due to increasing the optimization computational time for large scale cases, a Lagrangian Relaxation Algorithm (LRA) is applied as a solution method, considering the nature of the problem and the mathematical model; first, the model was investigated to choose the most appropriate constraints to be relaxed. Then, relaxed constraints are added to the objective function with Lagrangian multipliers. The problem is solved by a subgradient-based Lagrangian relaxation method while the Lagrangian multipliers are updated concerning the amount of violation of relaxed constraints in each iteration. Finally, to validate the current research, numerical examples for the presented model are solved and consequently, the results of various sensitivity analyses are reported. The computational results indicate both the efficiency and applicability of the proposed model in real-world conditions compared to existing classic models as well as the efficiency of the solution algorithm.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
In this paper, a green transportation location problem is considered with uncertain demand parameter. Increasing robustness influences the number of trucks for sending goods and products, caused consequently, increase the air pollution. In this paper, two green approaches are introduced which demand is the main uncertain parameter in both. These approaches are addressed to provide a trade-off between using available trucks and buying new hybrid trucks for evaluating total costs beside air pollution. Due to growing complexity, a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is applied to find a tight lower bound for each approach. In this propounded algorithm, the main model is decomposed into master and subproblems to speed up convergence with a tight gap. Finally, the suggested algorithm is compared with commercial solver regarding total cost and computational time. Due to computational results for the proposed approach, the Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is provided a close lower bound in less time against commercial solver.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Improving transportation systems are explored from several perspectives, one of which is the reduction of shipping costs, with emphasis on efficient network design. In this research, a three-level transportation location problem included origin, destination and middle warehouses is proposed to design an efficient network for responding to customer’s demand in light of minimizing system costs. In this model, customer demand is assumed uncertain to be able to bring the conditions governing this model closer to real-world situations. In this research, according to demand uncertainty, two stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches have been used to deal with this uncertainty. Also, in order to consider the stochastic programming approach, it is assumed that historical data about demand in reliable and scattered based is available. In the robust optimization, it is assumed that there is no historical data from the past to consider.
Due to the time-consuming and reduced efficiency of commercial optimization softwares in large-scale problems, some algorithms are presented. In this study, Lagrangian and Benders decomposition algorithms are used for implementation on location transportation problem under demand uncertainty.
Finally, for validating the presented study, several numerical examples are presented for each of the proposed models and algorithms to evaluate and verify their performance, and the results of various sensitivity analyses are reported. The computational results show the efficiency and applicability of the model, and the solution methods presented in real conditions compared to the classical solvers and algorithms.
