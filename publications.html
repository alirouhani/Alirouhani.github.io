<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
At the times of COVID-19 pandemic, resources at some critical locations became scarce due to supply disruptions and/or demand surges. While several works have discussed capacity expansions by investments in additional facilities (i.e., fixed capacities) and inventory stockpiling as possible mitigation and recovery strategies, another research stream has been profiled in investigating the value of flexibility and collaboration in managing supply chain (SC) disruptions. Our study aims at investigating the benefits of designing the distribution networks as collaborative platforms using flexible capacity allocation and expansion along with inventory sharing by cooperative users. We study a two-echelon SC network structure composed of distribution centers (DCs) and demand locations (DLs) as a set of customers with stochastic demand and capacity disruptions. The SC network contains cooperative users whereby the cooperative users are DLs that possess inventories and can help DCs supply DLs as well.  We conceptualize the notion of a collaborative distribution platform (CDP) and demonstrate the advantages of CDP deployment under severe disruptions through a joint employment of robust optimisation and multi-stage stochastic programming. The capacity is allocated to each facility in the worst-case scenario to control future capacity disruptions. Therefore, the worst-case capacity allocation and inventory management can confront the facility capacity disruption in both reactive and proactive ways. A suitable scenario tree is generated by using a Latin hypercube sampling method and reducing the scenario tree by applying a forward scenario construction technique. To overcome challenges in solving large-scale problems, a hybrid dual decomposition algorithm is suggested based on updating Lagrangian multiplier sets with the combination of cutting plane, sub-gradient, and trust region strategies. The proposed solution algorithm is also equipped by rolling horizon heuristic to find a proper upper bound. The outcomes of this research can help decision-makers utilize the value of CDP and cooperative users while preparing for and reacting to severe disruptions.

<li><p><b> A Rolling Horizon Heuristic for Blood Maximum Coverage Problem with Drone Under Uncertainty </b>, with H. Jahani, D. Ivanov </p>

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
Nowadays, blood delivery with drones becomes an important application of unmanned aerial vehicles to save people's lives, especially to hard-to-reach medical centers or for urgent blood orders. In this paper, we formulate a maximal covering location problem to find the drone sites to cover as possible medical centers with minimum total cost. Climate conditions besides handling uncertain urgent demands of medical centers are considered in our model. In the case of extreme climate events, the coverage radius of the drone sites may be reduced or disrupted. The Minimax-with-regret joint chance-constrained programming is employed to cope with the weather condition and urgent demand uncertainty. To improve the applicability of the proposed problem, we benefit from cooperation drone sites when each drone site cannot satisfy it's covered medical centers' urgent demand. An accelerated rolling horizon heuristic technique with lifted cover inequality is developed to solve the blood maximum coverage problem, which scenarios are generated by Halton sequence sampling. Finally, various numerical examples are solved to validate the proposed model. The computational results illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed model in real-world conditions as well as the efficiency of the solution algorithm.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
In pandemic situations, governments try to prevent further outbreaks by defining multi-stage restrictions. These limitations decrease as the outbreak slows. In these circumstances, the well-timed delivery of customer demand can lead to the best possible implementation of the restrictions imposed by governments. In this paper, an attempt has been made to provide a model that, in the first stage, according to a predefined time window by customers and resource constraints, a suitable time window is assigned to customers. In the second stage, the customers' demand will be delivered related to the assigned time window under uncertainty. An adaptive robust optimization is used to characterize the suggested problem under demand uncertainty and linearized by affine decision rules as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. To solve the proposed problem, we provide a branch and cut method with defining some valid inequalities and their related separation heuristics. The numerical results validate the proposed problem and correspond solution method.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
In this paper, we design a stochastic disaster relief logistic network for proper distributing relief aid in the post-disaster situation to handle the inherent uncertainty in such cases. We formulate the proposed problem as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming framework where constructing distribution channels of delivery relief aid are investigated as the first stage decisions. Moreover, the decisions of opening facilities and flows between network levels are determined in the second stage. In this study, we suggest an accelerated cross decomposition algorithm as the integration of benders and lagrangean decomposition methods to solve the proposed problem with mixed-integer variables in both the first and second stage decisions. We benefit from an on-demand accuracy strategy to generate benders optimality cuts related to active partitions of scenarios on an optimal solution where the partitions are refined dynamically within the solution algorithm. Computational results confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with the classic exact solution approaches, even for instances with a large number of scenarios.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
In this paper, a green transportation location problem is considered with uncertain demand parameter. Increasing robustness influences the number of trucks for sending goods and products, caused consequently, increase the air pollution. In this paper, two green approaches are introduced which demand is the main uncertain parameter in both. These approaches are addressed to provide a trade-off between using available trucks and buying new hybrid trucks for evaluating total costs beside air pollution. Due to growing complexity, a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is applied to find a tight lower bound for each approach. In this propounded algorithm, the main model is decomposed into master and subproblems to speed up convergence with a tight gap. Finally, the suggested algorithm is compared with commercial solver regarding total cost and computational time. Due to computational results for the proposed approach, the Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is provided a close lower bound in less time against commercial solver.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Improving transportation systems are explored from several perspectives, one of which is the reduction of shipping costs, with emphasis on efficient network design. In this research, a three-level transportation location problem included origin, destination and middle warehouses is proposed to design an efficient network for responding to customer’s demand in light of minimizing system costs. In this model, customer demand is assumed uncertain to be able to bring the conditions governing this model closer to real-world situations. In this research, according to demand uncertainty, two stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches have been used to deal with this uncertainty. Also, in order to consider the stochastic programming approach, it is assumed that historical data about demand in reliable and scattered based is available. In the robust optimization, it is assumed that there is no historical data from the past to consider. <br />
Due to the time-consuming and reduced efficiency of commercial optimization softwares in large-scale problems, some algorithms are presented. In this study, Lagrangian and Benders decomposition algorithms are used for implementation on location transportation problem under demand uncertainty. <br />
Finally, for validating the presented study, several numerical examples are presented for each of the proposed models and algorithms to evaluate and verify their performance, and the results of various sensitivity analyses are reported. The computational results show the efficiency and applicability of the model, and the solution methods presented in real conditions compared to the classical solvers and algorithms. <br />
