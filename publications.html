<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
One of the most tactical decisions in disaster management is assigning Disaster Response Groups (DRG) to predetermined districts. In the response phase, this assignment protects community assets and infrastructures that are under the risk of destruction when a disaster has occurred. Asset protection is continued to protect individuals, equipment and the environment during a disaster until the risk is reduced to an acceptable level. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer model is proposed for the Multi-District Asset Protection Problem (MDAP) with an uncertain time limit. Due to increasing the optimization computational time for large scale cases, a Lagrangian Relaxation Algorithm (LRA) is applied as a solution method, considering the nature of the problem and the mathematical model; first, the model was investigated to choose the most appropriate constraints to be relaxed. Then, relaxed constraints are added to the objective function with Lagrangian multipliers. The problem is solved by a subgradient-based Lagrangian relaxation method while the Lagrangian multipliers are updated concerning the amount of violation of relaxed constraints in each iteration. Finally, to validate the current research, numerical examples for the presented model are solved and consequently, the results of various sensitivity analyses are reported. The computational results indicate both the efficiency and applicability of the proposed model in real-world conditions compared to existing classic models as well as the efficiency of the solution algorithm.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
Capacity allocation and cooperative users are growing research areas in supply chain (SC) management; however, the consideration of these novel approaches with disruption propagation effects - namely ripple and bullwhip effects - is scarce. In this study, an SC network containing facilities, normal users, and cooperative users is considered in which the cooperative users possess inventories and can help facilities supply normal users as well. We aim to control the ripple effect by considering the robust optimization approach and dynamically adjusting the disrupted capacity of facilities. We also manage the bullwhip effect by adjusting the inventories of the cooperative users with a multi-stage stochastic programming formulation. The capacity is allocated to each facility in the worst-case scenario to control future capacity disruptions. Therefore, the worst-case capacity allocation and inventory management can confront the facility capacity disruption in both reactive and proactive ways. Regarding the solution approach, a multi-stage stochastic programming and a robust optimization approach are developed to control random and deep uncertainties. A suitable scenario tree is constructed by generating scenarios using a Latin Hypercube Sampling method and reducing the scenario tree by applying a forward scenario construction technique. To overcome challenges in solving largescale problems, a hybrid dual decomposition algorithm is suggested based on updating Lagrangian multiplier sets with the combination of cutting plane, sub-gradient, and trust region strategies. The proposed solution algorithm is equipped by Rolling Horizon Heuristic to find a proper upper bound. The outcomes of this research can help decision-makers analyze the value of cooperative users in mitigating ripple and bullwhip.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
Decomposition methods are one of the successful methods to solve large-scale MILP problems. These methods can apply to the primal or dual structure of the problems such as L-Shaped decomposition and Lagrangian Relaxation. The cross-decomposition algorithm alternates between Benders decomposition as the primal solution algorithm and Lagrangian relaxation as a dual solution algorithm in a unified approach. In this study, we suggest a cross decomposition algorithm to solve risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming with mixed-integer variables in both first and second stage decisions. Moreover, the lagrangian relaxation is equipped by using a hybrid procedure for updating lagrange multipliers included cutting plane and sub-gradient methods. We benefit from an on-demand accuracy strategy to generate benders optimality cuts related to active partitions of scenarios on an optimal solution where the partitions are refined dynamically within the solution algorithm. In this paper, the capacitated transportation location problem is modeled as a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming framework to handle the inherent demand uncertainty. In this model, unlike the classic one, constructing distribution channels are investigated as the first stage of decisions. Moreover, the decisions of opening origins and flows between network levels are determined in the second stage. As an application, this problem can be considered in the spreading of pandemic disease, where constructing distribution channels are strategic decisions in such networks. Computational results confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared with the classic exact solution approaches, even for instances with a large number of scenarios.

<article><p><b>Abstract</b>: 
In this paper, a green transportation location problem is considered with uncertain demand parameter. Increasing robustness influences the number of trucks for sending goods and products, caused consequently, increase the air pollution. In this paper, two green approaches are introduced which demand is the main uncertain parameter in both. These approaches are addressed to provide a trade-off between using available trucks and buying new hybrid trucks for evaluating total costs beside air pollution. Due to growing complexity, a Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is applied to find a tight lower bound for each approach. In this propounded algorithm, the main model is decomposed into master and subproblems to speed up convergence with a tight gap. Finally, the suggested algorithm is compared with commercial solver regarding total cost and computational time. Due to computational results for the proposed approach, the Lagrangian decomposition algorithm is provided a close lower bound in less time against commercial solver.

<li><p><b>Controlling Demand Ambiguity and Risk in Newsvendor Models</b>, with G. Bayraksan and T. Homem-de-Mello <br /></p>

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: We use distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to model a general class of newsvendor problems with unknown demand distribution.  The goal is to find an order quantity that minimizes the worst-case expected cost among an ambiguity set of distributions. The ambiguity set consists of those distributions that are not far&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;in the sense of the total variation distance&#8201;&mdash;&#8201;from a nominal distribution. The maximum distance allowed in the ambiguity set (called <i>level of robustness</i>) places the DRO between the risk-neutral stochastic programming and robust optimization models. An important problem a decision maker faces is how to determine the level of robustness—or, equivalently, how to find an appropriate level of risk-aversion. We answer this question in two ways. Our first approach relates the level of robustness and risk to the regions of demand that are critical (in a precise sense we introduce) to the optimal cost. Our second approach establishes new quantitative relationships between the DRO model and the corresponding risk-neutral and classical robust optimization models. To achieve these goals, we first focus on a single-product setting and derive explicit formulas and properties of the optimal solution as a function of the level of robustness. Then, we demonstrate the practical and managerial relevance of our results by applying our findings to a healthcare problem to reserve operating room time for cardiovascular surgeries. Finally, we extend some of our results to the multi-product setting and illustrate them numerically.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Traditional stochastic programs assume that the probability distribution of uncertainty is known. However, in practice, the probability distribution oftentimes is not known or cannot be accurately approximated. One way to address such distributional ambiguity is to work with distributionally robust convex stochastic programs (DRSPs), which minimize the worst-case expected cost with respect to a set of probability distributions. In this paper we analyze the case where there is a finite number of possible scenarios and study the question of how to identify the critical scenarios resulting from solving a DRSP. We illustrate that not all, but only some scenarios might have &ldquo;effect&rdquo; on the optimal value, and we formally define this notion for our general class of problems. In particular, we examine problems where the distributional ambiguity is modeled by the so-called total variation distance. We propose easy-to-check conditions to identify <i>effective</i> and <i>ineffective</i> scenarios for that class of problems. Computational results show that identifying effective scenarios provides useful insight on the underlying uncertainties of the problem.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we study the multi-period distributed generation planning problem in a multistage hierarchical distribution network. We first formulate the problem as a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Since the proposed model is non-convex and generally hard to solve, we convexify the model based on semi-definite programming. Then, we use a customized Benders’ decomposition method with valid cuts to solve the convex relaxation model. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient way to solve the problem for relatively large-scale networks.

</li>
<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: We study a risk-averse approach to multistage stochastic linear programming, where the conditional value-at-risk is incorporated into the objective function as the risk measure. We consider five decompositions of the resulting risk-averse model to solve it via the nested L-shaped method. We introduce separate approximations of the mean and the risk measure and also investigate the effectiveness of multiple cuts. As an application, we formulate a water allocation problem by risk-averse multistage programming, which has the advantage of controlling high-risk severe water shortage events. We apply the proposed formulation to the southeastern portion of Tucson, AZ to best use the limited water resources available to that region. In numerical experiments we (1) present a comparative computational study of the risk-averse nested L-shaped variants and (2) analyze the risk-averse approach to the water allocation problem.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: This paper is seeking to design a dynamic cellular manufacturing system (DCMS). Area of multi-objective optimization is attractive not only for offering new opportunities for defining problem, but it helps us to extend and solve the anonymous problem. So a new multi-objective mixed integer model is presented for DCMS. The proposed model considers some real-world critical conditions in lean production which are neglected in similar studies in the literature. This model solves the part and machine grouping simultaneously with labor assignment to minimize the cost of various terms like reassignment cost of human resource, over time cost of equipments and labors, and maximize utilization rate of human resource. The model is linearized and validated with GAMS 22.1&copy;plex. Because the Benders&rsquo; decomposition approach has not been applied to solve multi-objective CMS problems so far, we use this method to solve our model. The results are presented at the end.

</li>
<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: In this paper, we study a capacitated multiple allocation hub location problem, where the amount of flow that hub nodes can collect from non-hub nodes is constrained. The underlying network is assumed to be complete and the distance between nodes are assumed to be unstructured, in contrast to the networks in which distances satisfy the triangle inequality. To route the flow on each non-hub to hub link and to prevent constructing underutilized networks, a flow threshold for each non-hub and hub link is assumed. Moreover, in order to improve the service level, a coverage radius is defined for each hub node. As good formulations of mixed-integer programming models are part of the solution process, we identify some properties of the optimal solutions by utilizing the structure of the problem. In addition, we derive facet-defining flow cover and knapsack cover inequalities to strengthen the formulation. The computational experiences on medium sized instances of Australia Post show that generating facet-defining inequalities can significantly improve the lower bound of the usual linear programming relaxation.

</li>
<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Assessing the values of research and development project using pricing a portfolio of real options is an approach that may safeguard against investment risks and may provide opportunities to benefit from the growth in the underlying assets. In this paper, we study a robust Markov decision process approach for pricing a portfolio of risky assets and real options on them. It is assumed that the investment budget is limited and the returns on the underlying assets are uncertain and correlated. Recognizing that the returns on real-world assets are uncertain, the proposed robust Markov decision process may be used for real-world decision-making problems in business and industry. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed approach on a small problem and obtain the optimal investment policy.

</li>
<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a well-known problem on combinatorial optimization and has been proved to be NP-hard. In this paper, with some assumptions, a novel approach to VRP is established. Some central depots exist for goods distribution among customers (multi depot). Customers can both receive and deliver goods from/to central depots such that these operations are done simultaneously by vehicles (simultaneously pickup and delivery). Vehicles, after serving customers, at the end of their routes, will freely choose their end central depots (flexible assignment of depots). Also, each customer’s demand can be met by more than one vehicle (split service). To demonstrate the advantages of taking the mentioned assumption in VRP, the presented model is solved by the proposed Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) and the results will be presented.

<li><p><i>Proceedings of the 1st International Logistics and Supply Chain Conference</i>, Tehran, Iran, 2009</p>
</li>
<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Hub facilities locating problem arises in situation where some flow must be transported from origins to destinations, but it is impossible or too expensive to establish a direct link between each origin/destination pair. In this situation, a group of nodes is chosen to locate hubs. In location allocation problem, hubs are located and origins and destinations nodes will be allocated to hubs. we can probe hub applications in transportation, logistic and telecommunication. 
A different approach to capacitated multiple allocation hub location problem is addressed in this paper. In addition, flow threshold and fixed cost is considered for spoke links. Capacity constraint that limits hub inflow is behaved as a soft constraint rather than a hard. To achieving this purpose, capacity constraint is eliminated and the problem is formulated with a second objective function besides the traditional transportation cost minimizing function. Two bi-criteria MIP models are formulated: In first model, minimization of total time for processing hubs inflow and in second model, minimization of maximum time for processing hubs inflow is considered as second objective function. To solve the models, Goal Programming method is introduced and used. Two bi-criteria models are tested based on AP data set.

<li><article><p><b>Abstract</b>: Improving transportation systems are explored from several perspectives, one of which is the reduction of shipping costs, with emphasis on efficient network design. In this research, a three-level transportation location problem included origin, destination and middle warehouses is proposed to design an efficient network for responding to customer’s demand in light of minimizing system costs. In this model, customer demand is assumed uncertain to be able to bring the conditions governing this model closer to real-world situations. In this research, according to demand uncertainty, two stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches have been used to deal with this uncertainty. Also, in order to consider the stochastic programming approach, it is assumed that historical data about demand in reliable and scattered based is available. In the robust optimization, it is assumed that there is no historical data from the past to consider. <br />
Due to the time-consuming and reduced efficiency of commercial optimization softwares in large-scale problems, some algorithms are presented. In this study, Lagrangian and Benders decomposition algorithms are used for implementation on location transportation problem under demand uncertainty. <br />
Finally, for validating the presented study, several numerical examples are presented for each of the proposed models and algorithms to evaluate and verify their performance, and the results of various sensitivity analyses are reported. The computational results show the efficiency and applicability of the model, and the solution methods presented in real conditions compared to the classical solvers and algorithms. <br />
